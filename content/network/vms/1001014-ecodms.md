Create the following classification attributes:

* Reference: text
* Foreign reference: text

* Administrative notice
* Complaint
* Receipt
* Letter

### Other settings

Under *Web / Mobile / API* and *Web access*, enable web access on port `8080` (and forward that outside through `portproxy`).

## Backups

On the server, run:

```sh
mkdir -p /backup/full
chmod -R ecodms /backup
```

Go into *Options* and *Settings*. Under *Settings* and *Backup*, set the path to `/backup` and enable automatic daily backups for 4 AM. Select *Incremental backup* and enable email reports. Issue a manual backup to test the settings.

Create the script `~/full_backup.sh` as shown below and `chmod +x ~/full_backup.sh`.

The instance is backed up to Backblaze B2 using restic. Follow the steps in [Net/Restic]({{< ref "network/restic" >}}), using `/backup` as the backup folder.
