Welcome to docs.benjamin-altpeter.de. This website is generated from the [baltpeter/docs](https://github.com/baltpeter/docs) repository on GitHub, where I keep my personal docs archive for various topics.

As these docs are mostly kept for myself, some may seem a little rough or lacking details. I still think that publishing this archive can be useful for others. If you think an entry can be improved, please feel free to submit your pull request! Every entry contains an 'Edit on GitHub' link at the top that lets you directly edit it on GitHub.
