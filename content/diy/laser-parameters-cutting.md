title: Laser cutter parameters cutting
---

These are the parameters to use when cutting various materials with my K40 laser. They have been discovered by trial and error.

## Acrylic (3 mm)

* Power: 40% (although 30% â€“ 39% might work as well)
* Speed: 2 mm/s (you might get away with 2.5 mm/s but 3 mm/s is usually too much)

## Chinese balsa wood (2 mm)

**Note:** This stuff is _very_ likely to start burning in the process. These values are not yet ideal, we might want to try going with lower power/speed and do two passes, which would be easier on the wood.

* Power: 15%
* Speed: 5 mm/s

bought from [here](https://www.ebay.de/itm/152749442896), very fragile

## Thin cardboard

**Note:** This will leave some heavy soot on the material, it's not exactly a clean cut.

* Power: 65%
* Speed: 25 mm/s
* Runs: 3

## Corrugated cardboard (from Amazon boxes)

* Power: 55%
* Speed: 25 mm/s

## Paper

* Power: 15%
* Speed: 30 mm/s

## Wood

### Poplar plywood (4 mm)

* Power: 80%
* Speed: 7 mm/s
* Air: yes
* Masking: yes
